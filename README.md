## Kalman Filter
The Kalman Filter (KF) is a set of mathematical equations that when operating together implement a predictor-corrector type of estimator that is optimal in the sense that it minimizes the estimated error covariance when some presumed conditions are met.

Kalman Filtering can be understood as a way of making sense of a noisy world.
